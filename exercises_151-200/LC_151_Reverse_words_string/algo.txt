Declare empty string as word and empty array as arr. Trim the input string from both ends. In for loop from beginning (or end - does not matter just array operation will be push), check if current char is not empty space, add it to the word variable. If encounter space, check if word is not 0 length, then add it to array arr at the end (if stated from string beginning), empty word variable, and continue for loop. AT the end of loop, first add remaining word to array, then return new string by joining array with space.
